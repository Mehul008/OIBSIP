                        Bruce Lee (Chinese: 李小龍; born Lee Jun-fan, Chinese: 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was
                        a
                        Hong Kong American martial artist, action film actor, martial arts instructor, philosopher,
                        filmmaker, and the founder of Jeet Kune Do. Lee was the son of Cantonese opera star Lee
                        Hoi-Chuen.
                        He is widely considered by commentators, critics, media and other martial artists to be one of
                        the
                        most influential martial artists of all time, and a pop culture icon of the 20th century. He is
                        often credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films. <a
